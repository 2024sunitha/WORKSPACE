<h2>CANADA TRAVEL GUIDE</h2>
<div>
<p>Ottawa is the capital city of Canada.It is located southrn portion of the province of Ontario.</p>
 
<p>Canada is a huge country, and the climate and weather will differ
     depending on the region you visit!
    Generally, the best time to visit is during the fal
    l months of August and September—the weather has cooled down a bit,
     but it’s still comfortable for outdoor activities. 
     Plus, the summer crowds have left, prices have dropped,
      and the foliage is starting to change color.
    
    Winter usually spans from October to March,
     though sometimes it can last up until April.
      During winter, Vancouver gets very little snow,
      while Montreal is typically freezing cold!</p>

    <p>The best times to visit Banff National Park are June to August, 
        for summer and outdoor activities,
         and December to March, for prime ski conditions.</p>

<p>Language: The two official languages of Canada are English and French, with over 80% of Canadians speaking English.

    Currency: The Canadian currency is the Canadian Dollar (CAD).
    
    Credit Cards & ATMs: You can often get by using your card to pay for purchases in Canada. 
    
    ATMs are also readily available everywhere you go if you do need to withdraw cash.
    
    Plugs: The plugs in Canada are type B (the same as the US). 
    The standard voltage is 110-120 V, and the standard frequency is 60Hz. For foreign travelers, 
    I recommend buying a universal adapter (make sure it has surge protection)
     and using a converter for hairdryers and hot tools.
    
    Safety: Canada is a very safe country to visit, and there’s hardly any violent crime committed.
     I consider it one of the top destinations for solo female travelers!</p>

 <h2>BANFF</h2>

 <p>Visitors can spend their days skiing or hiking in Banff National Park
  (one of <strong> most beautiful national parks </strong> and home of the glacier-fed Moraine Lake)
   and floating down the Bow River on a canoe before retiring to one of the area's several
    opulent hotels for some spa therapy. Then, for incredible views of the Rockies,
     take a ride on the Banff Gondola. Meanwhile, daytrips to popular attractions
like the Columbia Icefield,
  Yoho National Park and Lake Louise cannot be left off of your itinerary.</p>

 <h2>MONTREAL</h2>

 <h2>NIAGARA FALLS</h2>
 <p>Montréal is a city of juxtaposition: Skyscrapers rub elbows with Old Montréal's 
  17th-century architecture while the familiar sounds of English intermingle with the foreign buzz of French –
   the official language of Québec province. Visit Old Montréal to get a taste of Europe
    (think: beautiful architecture and cobblestone streets), including its own Notre-Dame Basilica, 
    a grand Gothic Revival-style church that offers self-guided tours along with an evening sound and light show.
     Then head to modern attractions, such as the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts. Meanwhile, 
     if you're visiting during the warmer months,
   don't miss out on the Montréal Botanical Garden and the scenic Mount Royal Park.</p>

 <img src="C:\BDDautomation\htmlimages\Niagarafalls.jpg" width="300" height="200"></img>
 <p>Travel to this iconic destination in southeastern Ontario to see and capture
   photos of its namesake <span>tourist attraction.</span> View Niagara Falls from
    above during a helicopter tour, or see them up close on the Maid of the Mist boat tour.
     Or, for a unique perspective, admire the thunderous falls from behind with the self-guided Journey 
     Behind the Falls experience. After you've taken in the splendor, check out the area's other top attractions,
      such as the Niagara Glen Nature Centre, which offers a variety of hiking trails.
   When you've had your fill of nature, head to nearby wineries or test Lady Luck at the casinos</p>

 <h2>QUEBEC CITY</h2>
 <img src="C:\BDDautomation\htmlimages/quebeccity.jpg" width="300" height="200"></img>
 <p>A trip to Europe may not be in your budget, but a visit to Québec City could be.
   This Canadian city charms visitors with its picturesque centuries-old buildings that
    make up Old Québec – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Meanwhile, the aromas of freshly
     baked bread and brewing espresso fill the cobblestone streets of the Quartier Petit-Champlain
      with the essence of Paris. Once you've gotten your fill of the city, take a trip to Montmorency Falls
       Park to marvel at its 272-foot-tall waterfall. Plan your visit for winter when the city comes alive
        with twinkling lights,
   festivals and cold-weather activities – just remember to pack your down jacket.</p>

 <h2>WHISTLER</h2>
 <img src="C:\BDDautomation\htmlimages/download.jpg" width="300" height="200"></img>
 <p>Take adventure travel up a notch with a visit to Whistler.
   In winter, this resort town in British Columbia (about 75 miles north of Vancouver)
   boasts everything from cross-country skiing and snowboarding to bobsled rides and bungee jumping.
    Travelers can spend their downtime in Whistler Village enjoying the après-ski scene, perusing locally
     owned shops or strolling through Whistler Olympic Plaza. Meanwhile, visitors in town when the weather
      is warmer can go hiking, fishing, horseback riding, kayaking and more. Plus, summer travelers will
       love exploring Brandywine Falls Provincial Park, home to the 230-foot-tall waterfall
        from which the park gets its name</p>

<h2>JASPER</h2>
  <p>Jasper National Park</p>
  <img src="C:\BDDautomation\htmlimages/Jaspernationalpark.jpg" width="300" height="200"></img>
  <p>As the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies,
    Jasper is ripe for exploration. When you're not hiking through Maligne Canyon,
     whitewater rafting down the Athabasca River or snapping photos of Spirit Island,
      you can enjoy a bird's-eye view of the picture-perfect scenery from the Jasper SkyTram. Or,
       take in the beauty of Jasper National Park while driving along the Icefields Parkway.
        Keep your eyes peeled for the 53 species of mammals 
    that call this Alberta park home, including black bears, elk and bighorn sheep.</p>
  <h2>VANCOUVER</h2>
<img src="C:\BDDautomation\htmlimages\Vancouver.jpg" width="300" height="200"></img>
<p>A trip to this British Columbia city, which sits approximately 145 miles north of Seattle
  , is all about embracing the outdoors. Vancouverites spend their days skiing on Grouse Mountain,
   swimming at Kitsilano Beach and strolling through the sprawling Stanley Park. Plus, Vancouver offers plenty
    of cultural attractions, including museums, art galleries and outdoor markets (a tour of Granville Island
     is a must-do). If you're not afraid of heights, walk across the Capilano Suspension Bridge,
   which is positioned 230 feet above the Capilano River</p>
